    #  SC2002: Useless cat. Consider 'cmd < file | ..' or 'cmd file | ..' instead.
    # Check exit code directly with e.g. 'if mycmd;', not indirectly with $?. Might be worth disable in in the future
    # SC2181: Check exit code directly with e.g. 'if mycmd;', not indirectly with $?.
    # SC2153: Possible misspelling: DOMAIN may not be assigned, but domain is. - Issues with SOURCE importing vars that are not defined in the script it self but config files
    # SC2016: Expressions don't expand in single quotes, use double quotes for that. - History reasons
    # SC2196: egrep is non-standard and deprecated. Use grep -E instead. Todo be removed in the future
    # SC1090; Can't follow non-constant source. Use a directive to specify location. - Hestia loves $HESTIA/data/ips/$ip
    # SC2031: var was modified in a subshell. That change might be lost.
